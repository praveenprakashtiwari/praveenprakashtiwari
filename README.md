I am Praveen Prakash Tiwari. I am a young hustler & have pursued my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai. I am just 20 and I have completed my class X and class XII - the best phase of my life from St. Thomasâ€™ School, Dwarka, New Delhi which is also my native city where I am from but I am proficient in speaking Tamil even along with English and Hindi.

I am Technically Proficient in Data Science, JavaScript, Python3, Full Stack Development, Web Development, Application Development, IOS Development, MySQL, C++ Language, Blockchain Development and Graphic Designing which helped me to work as an App Developer for the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Chennai and as a Software Developer in Central Coalfields Limited, Ranchi where I worked in a Team and made some real time projects for organization. Along with that, I worked on many real time projects during my four years of Graduation including Local Helper Finder and Student Grievance Redressal System.

Recently, I was working as a Team Leader and Technical Associate for various clubs of my College and Volunteered in National Level-Tech Fest Aaruush which taught me how to work in a team and manage people and resources. Other than that, I am working as a Real-Estate Agent and running two restaurants near SRM University.

Now, my focus is not only enhancing these skills but also creating new Entrepreneurship skills to make an impact on society. Ultimately, trying to make the world a better place to live.
